# ome-zarr-examples
Keeping track of ome-zarr generation from different microscopes and formats. At the moment I include minimal examples for:

1. Lightsheet 7 from ZEISS: ***.czi*** metadata is stored in the file and I use tools provided by the ZEISS team to load the image one plane at the time.
2. Thermofisher MAPS: file structure of ***.tif*** that form a pyramid scheme. Metadata info is stored in ***.xml*** files.
3. multiSEM from ZEISS: file structire of ***.bmp***. Metadata info in stored in ***.txt*** and ***.csv*** files.
